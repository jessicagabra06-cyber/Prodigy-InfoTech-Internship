# Titanic Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis  

This project focuses on preparing and analyzing the Titanic dataset.  
The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, converting categorical variables, and checking for duplicates and outliers. After cleaning, the dataset was explored through statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover key insights into survival patterns.  

The analysis reveals how factors like **gender, class, age, and socioeconomic status** strongly influenced survival, confirming the "women and children first" protocol as well as the privilege of wealthier passengers.  

## Features  
- Handling missing values (median/mode imputation, removal of irrelevant columns)  
- Outlier inspection and treatment decisions  
- Encoding and preparing categorical variables  
- Visualizations of survival by:  
  - Gender  
  - Passenger class  
  - Age groups  
  - Port of embarkation  
- Correlation analysis between numeric variables  
- Socioeconomic gradient in survival outcomes (Fare as proxy for wealth)
